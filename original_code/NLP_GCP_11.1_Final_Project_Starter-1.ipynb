THE CANADIAN PRESS/AP, Invision - Jonathan Short\\nA new Drake x The Weeknd song just dropped – but it’s an AI fake\\nCopright law around generative AI remains murky\\n Black Press Media StaffApr. 17, 2023 2:30 p.m.EntertainmentVideo \\n\\nAn AI-generated song called “Heart On My Sleeve” featuring the voices of Drake and The Weeknd has garnered 250,000 Spotify streams and 10 million TikTok views, prompting concerns about the legality and ethics of using artists’ content without their consent.\\nAccording to American technology magazine TechCrunch, Drake recently commented on AI-generated music that uses his voice, calling it the “final straw AI.” UMG, which represents artists like Eminem and Jay-Z, has issued copyright strikes against AI-generated YouTube videos featuring their music.\\nCopyright laws around the use of AI are murky, though. Transformative parody is generally allowed, but there are no specific guidelines on generative AI. Interpretation of these laws is subjective and precedent-setting case law is scarce.\\nUMG has asked Spotify to prevent AI companies from using its music to train their models, citing a moral and commercial responsibility to its artists.\\nOnce AI-generated content is up, it’s hard to remove. A project called Spawning AI helps artist to search for their work to see if it’s being used in an AI training set without their consent, but removing intellectual property from AI models is difficult.\\nIt remains to be seen how artists, platforms and lawmakers will navigate the ethical and legal complexities of AI-generated content in the future.\\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter. \\n artificial intelligenceMusic\\nBe Among The First To Know\\nCreate a free account today, and start receiving free newsletters.\\n\\nSign Up with google\\nSign Up with facebook\\n\\n                        or\\n                    \\n\\n                        Email Address\\n                        \\n\\n                        First Name\\n                        \\n\\n\\n                        Last Name\\n                        \\n                    This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google\\n                    Privacy Policy and\\n                    Terms of Service apply.\\n                \\n\\n\\n                        Create a password\\n                        \\n\\n\\nSign Up\\n\\nComplete Registration\\n\\n\\n                    Already registered?

While the other marketplaces deal in third-party data, Corrigan said that Informatica’s Cloud Data Marketplace is aimed at sharing data and other AI assets within an organisation.\"It's not as if people are putting it up for sale within an enterprise, but it's a marketplace type of concept where it's a place to go and find data and to also share data,” Corrigan said.The Cloud Data Marketplace targets business users, in contrast with Informatica's Enterprise Data Catalog (EDC), a similar data marketplace that works with the company's Axon data governance platform and targets more technical users within an organisation, explained IDC research director of data integration software Stewart Bond.As enterprises build increasingly complex analytics applications and AI models, data governance is a big issue. Use of improperly formatted data, for example, can have high costs for companies.  A joint report, released by analytics platform Alteryx and IDC in 2019, showed that data workers globally spend a full 44 per cent of their workday on unsuccessful data activities.Cloud Data Marketplace will feature a dynamic sharing agreement with terms and conditions to ensure that the organisation’s data assets are used responsibly, with full auditability over compliant use, Corrigan said. The software will also offer insights and transparency on levels of consumption, where data is being used and for what purposes.Informatica is taking advantage of its large installed base and adding this data marketplace as an add-on feature to its Intelligent Data Management Cloud, said Doug Henschen, vice president and principal analyst at Constellation Research. “Informatica stands to gain consumption-based usage fees, and there’s also the hope that large Informatica customers will encourage partners and data suppliers to transact through the Marketplace, potentially bringing more customers to Informatica,” he said.Informatica's Intelligent Data Management Cloud, announced in April, features more than 250 AI-driven cloud services designed to help enterprises catalog, ingest, integrate, and prep data for use in analytics and AI applications. \\n\\nWorking together to build better sustainability\\n\\nMore from HP \\n        Tags informaticaClouddata\\nRead next\\nCisco shuffles ASEAN leadership, Bee Kheng Tay takes regional reins\\n4 big ways businesses can put Zoom apps to work\\nChannel Asia Hall of Fame\\n\\nFollow us\\n\\nTwitter\\nFacebook\\nLinkedIn\\nRSS\\n\\nEvents\\n\\nChannel Asia WIICTA 2021\\nChannel Asia Innovation Awards 2021\\n\\nBrand Post\\n\\n        Why Kubernetes should be central to your digital transformation journey\\n      \\n\\n\\nSponsored By\\nRelated Whitepapers\\nShow Comments\\n\\n\\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\\nManila makes Microsoft move as digital ambitions become reality\\n \\n\\nCopyright 2021 IDG Communications.

Over a month later, Google still hasn’t kicked off public testing for the chatbot, but that might change soon. In recent days, Google began sending early access invites to select members of the Pixel Superfan community to test Bard and share feedback to improve the chatbot before it launches.\\nGoogle is inching closer to launching Bard \\n“Meet Bard, an early experiment by Google that lets you collaborate with generative AI,” reads the invite. “We’d like to offer you – a member of our Pixel Superfan community – early access so you can get started as soon as Bard launches, and share your feedback.”\\n\\n\\t\\n\\nThe invite goes on to ask the recipient to complete a form and notes that this opportunity has only been offered to “a small, randomly selected group of Pixel Superfans.”\\nGoogle didn’t share any additional information, but it certainly seems like Bard will see the light of day in the coming weeks. Google had to have known that word of these emailed invitations would spread, so we hope to hear more from the company soon. In the meantime, we’ll be keeping an eye out for people who are invited to the early access test.\\nWhile Bard is still a work in progress, Google’s AI ambitions are larger than just a chatbot. Last week, the company revealed numerous AI-powered features coming to Gmail, Docs, Meet, and Chat, including the ability to draft documents, generate images, and reply to emails.\\nIf you want a chance to participate in future tests like this, you can sign up for a chance to join the Pixel Superfan community by filling out this form from Google.\\nDon’t Miss: This free app helps you find tons of useful ChatGPT prompts \\n\\n\\nThis article talks about:\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBard\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tGoogle\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tJacob Siegal, \\n\\n\\nAssociate Editor\\n \\n\\nJacob Siegal is Associate Editor at BGR, having joined the news team in 2013.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/AP, Invision - Jonathan Short\\nA new Drake x The Weeknd song just dropped – but it’s an AI fake\\nCopright law around generative AI remains murky\\n Black Press Media StaffApr. 17, 2023 2:30 p.m.EntertainmentVideo \\n\\nAn AI-generated song called “Heart On My Sleeve” featuring the voices of Drake and The Weeknd has garnered 250,000 Spotify streams and 10 million TikTok views, prompting concerns about the legality and ethics of using artists’ content without their consent.\\nAccording to American technology magazine TechCrunch, Drake recently commented on AI-generated music that uses his voice, calling it the “final straw AI.” UMG, which represents artists like Eminem and Jay-Z, has issued copyright strikes against AI-generated YouTube videos featuring their music.\\nCopyright laws around the use of AI are murky, though. Transformative parody is generally allowed, but there are no specific guidelines on generative AI. Interpretation of these laws is subjective and precedent-setting case law is scarce.\\nUMG has asked Spotify to prevent AI companies from using its music to train their models, citing a moral and commercial responsibility to its artists.\\nOnce AI-generated content is up, it’s hard to remove. A project called Spawning AI helps artist to search for their work to see if it’s being used in an AI training set without their consent, but removing intellectual property from AI models is difficult.\\nIt remains to be seen how artists, platforms and lawmakers will navigate the ethical and legal complexities of AI-generated content in the future.\\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter. \\n artificial intelligenceMusic\\nBe Among The First To Know\\nCreate a free account today, and start receiving free newsletters.\\n\\nSign Up with google\\nSign Up with facebook\\n\\n                        or\\n                    \\n\\n                        Email Address\\n                        \\n\\n                        First Name\\n                        \\n\\n\\n                        Last Name\\n                        \\n                    This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google\\n                    Privacy Policy and\\n                    Terms of Service apply.\\n                \\n\\n\\n                        Create a password\\n                        \\n\\n\\nSign Up\\n\\nComplete Registration\\n\\n\\n                    Already registered?

While the other marketplaces deal in third-party data, Corrigan said that Informatica’s Cloud Data Marketplace is aimed at sharing data and other AI assets within an organisation.\"It's not as if people are putting it up for sale within an enterprise, but it's a marketplace type of concept where it's a place to go and find data and to also share data,” Corrigan said.The Cloud Data Marketplace targets business users, in contrast with Informatica's Enterprise Data Catalog (EDC), a similar data marketplace that works with the company's Axon data governance platform and targets more technical users within an organisation, explained IDC research director of data integration software Stewart Bond.As enterprises build increasingly complex analytics applications and AI models, data governance is a big issue. Use of improperly formatted data, for example, can have high costs for companies.  A joint report, released by analytics platform Alteryx and IDC in 2019, showed that data workers globally spend a full 44 per cent of their workday on unsuccessful data activities.Cloud Data Marketplace will feature a dynamic sharing agreement with terms and conditions to ensure that the organisation’s data assets are used responsibly, with full auditability over compliant use, Corrigan said. The software will also offer insights and transparency on levels of consumption, where data is being used and for what purposes.Informatica is taking advantage of its large installed base and adding this data marketplace as an add-on feature to its Intelligent Data Management Cloud, said Doug Henschen, vice president and principal analyst at Constellation Research. “Informatica stands to gain consumption-based usage fees, and there’s also the hope that large Informatica customers will encourage partners and data suppliers to transact through the Marketplace, potentially bringing more customers to Informatica,” he said.Informatica's Intelligent Data Management Cloud, announced in April, features more than 250 AI-driven cloud services designed to help enterprises catalog, ingest, integrate, and prep data for use in analytics and AI applications. \\n\\nWorking together to build better sustainability\\n\\nMore from HP \\n        Tags informaticaClouddata\\nRead next\\nCisco shuffles ASEAN leadership, Bee Kheng Tay takes regional reins\\n4 big ways businesses can put Zoom apps to work\\nChannel Asia Hall of Fame\\n\\nFollow us\\n\\nTwitter\\nFacebook\\nLinkedIn\\nRSS\\n\\nEvents\\n\\nChannel Asia WIICTA 2021\\nChannel Asia Innovation Awards 2021\\n\\nBrand Post\\n\\n        Why Kubernetes should be central to your digital transformation journey\\n      \\n\\n\\nSponsored By\\nRelated Whitepapers\\nShow Comments\\n\\n\\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\\nManila makes Microsoft move as digital ambitions become reality\\n \\n\\nCopyright 2021 IDG Communications.

Over a month later, Google still hasn’t kicked off public testing for the chatbot, but that might change soon. In recent days, Google began sending early access invites to select members of the Pixel Superfan community to test Bard and share feedback to improve the chatbot before it launches.\\nGoogle is inching closer to launching Bard \\n“Meet Bard, an early experiment by Google that lets you collaborate with generative AI,” reads the invite. “We’d like to offer you – a member of our Pixel Superfan community – early access so you can get started as soon as Bard launches, and share your feedback.”\\n\\n\\t\\n\\nThe invite goes on to ask the recipient to complete a form and notes that this opportunity has only been offered to “a small, randomly selected group of Pixel Superfans.”\\nGoogle didn’t share any additional information, but it certainly seems like Bard will see the light of day in the coming weeks. Google had to have known that word of these emailed invitations would spread, so we hope to hear more from the company soon. In the meantime, we’ll be keeping an eye out for people who are invited to the early access test.\\nWhile Bard is still a work in progress, Google’s AI ambitions are larger than just a chatbot. Last week, the company revealed numerous AI-powered features coming to Gmail, Docs, Meet, and Chat, including the ability to draft documents, generate images, and reply to emails.\\nIf you want a chance to participate in future tests like this, you can sign up for a chance to join the Pixel Superfan community by filling out this form from Google.\\nDon’t Miss: This free app helps you find tons of useful ChatGPT prompts \\n\\n\\nThis article talks about:\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBard\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tGoogle\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tJacob Siegal, \\n\\n\\nAssociate Editor\\n \\n\\nJacob Siegal is Associate Editor at BGR, having joined the news team in 2013.
