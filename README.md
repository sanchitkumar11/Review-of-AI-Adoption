<h1 style="">ü§î Executive Summary</h1>

Artificial Intelligence has burgeoned in recent years, carving out an indispensable role within a
host of sectors such as healthcare, law, and education. This analysis uses NLP techniques to
decipher meaningful insights from news articles ‚Äì spanning January 2020 to April 2023.


This project uses sentiment analysis, entity recognition, and topic modeling to identify
successful data science and AI initiatives and reasons for that. In addition, it also identifies
unsuccessful products or industries that have failed in its adoption of AI. Specifically,
Bertopic and LDA was employed for topic modeling, Spacy Large for entity extraction and
twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest from hugging face for sentiment.


After topics were extracted from positive and negative sentiment articles respectively,
targeted entity extraction was implemented to identify sentiment towards these entities. In
addition, Flan-t5-base was used for text summarization and targeted sentiment analysis.


This analysis promises to shed light on both the strides made in the AI industry and its
potential areas of growth. This research stands to benefit stakeholders such as investors
(venture capitalists), policymakers, companies looking to invest into data science in different
industries, and business professionals.

<h1 style="">üöÄ Future Work and Technical Conclusions</h1>


üí¨ **With more computation power, better results can be achieved through use of
sophisticated large language models.**

üìÉ **In terms of topic modeling, BERTopic outperforms traditional methods such
as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). It excels in assembling similar topics into
coherent clusters and does so in a computation-efficient manner, consuming
less memory.**

ü§ñ **Sentiment fine-tuning and extensive manual annotation are crucial for
accurately discerning the sentiment inherent in a text. Other methods such as
building a custom model on open-source data could be attempted.**

üßê **For entity extraction, transformer spacy could be used and compared.
Additionally, large language models, or alternatively, developing a NER system
on labeled data could potentially offer improvements in entity detection.**
